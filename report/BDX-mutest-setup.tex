\subsection{Detector location}
The area downstream of Hall-A beam-dump is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ds-area}  indicating test measurement locations relative to the 
new  underground facility proposed in PR-16-001~\cite{bdx-proposal}. The three positions, indicated with markers {\bf A, B}  and {\bf C},  correspond to the hall entrance (22.4 m downstream of the beam-dump entrance), a point in the middle  (25.2 m) and the exit (28 m), respectively. The experimental set-up we are proposing requires digging a well and inserting a pipe in one (or more) of these locations. The BDX-Hodo detector will be lowered in the pipe and the muon flux sampled at different heights wrt. nominal beam height. The muon flux profiles in Y (vertical direction), measured in  different locations in Z (distance from the dump), will allow us to compare the absolute and relative MC predictions. 

\subsection{The BDX-Hodo detector \label{sec:BDX-hodo}}
The detector used to measure the beam-on-related muon radiation and the background in the proximity of the new BDX underground facility will  make use of a BDX ECal CsI(Tl) crystal sandwiched between a set of segmented plastic scintillators.
A CAD representation as well as  a vertical and horizontal  cut with dimensions are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:det-cad}.

\end{figure}
The front of the crystal will be equipped with two  layers of plastic scintillators, each composed by  a large and a small 1 cm-thick scintillators strips. The overlap of the four paddles (each 20 cm long in Y)  results in three independent  2.5 cm channels along the X (horizontal) direction.
The same concept was applied to the  back side of the crystal but with paddles tilted by 90 degrees to define three 2.5 cm independent channels along the Y (vertical) direction. The requirement of a hit in both front and back paddles defines a 3x3 matrix of 2.5x2.5 cm$^2$ pixels providing a cm-like muon XY position resolution. 
The addition of a larger paddle (20 x 14.4 cm$^2$) on the back provides an enhanced sensitivity   in the unlikely  case rates will be much lower than what estimated by MC simulations.
Four more  paddles covering  the left/right sides and the top/bottom of the crystal will be used to veto cosmic rays and other radiation not associated to the beam direction.
The crystals will be coupled, on the large side,  to a 6x6 mm$^2$ Hamamatsu S13360-6025 SiPM as described in Sec. 3.2.1 of  PR-16-001~\cite{bdx-proposal}. The scintillator paddles will be  made with extruded plastic, each  read out via a WLS fiber coupled to a 3x3 mm$^2$ Hamamatsu S12572-100 SiPM sharing the same technology used in the BDX Inner Veto detector (described in details in Sec. 3.2.2 of  PR-16-001).
The detector will be contained  in a 20-cm diameter stainless-steel cylindrical vessel, covered on top and on the bottom by steel lids. The whole assembly will  be water-tight to prevent any water from leaking inside the vessel. A stainless-steel  extension on the top cover will be used  to run  cables (signal and power)  from the detector to the ground-level. The extension, made by a 1-inch stainless steel pipe,  rigidly attached to the whole assembly, will be also used  to remotely control the cylinder orientation  providing correct  the alignment of the BDX-Hodo wrt. the beam axes. \\
To record the 13 (scintillators) + 1 (crystal) channels a  single 16ch  fADC board and  a VME crate will suffice.
A loose condition  on the CsI(Tl) crystal will trigger the DAQ to record signals from all SiPMs.
Off-line, muons produced by the electron beam will be identified by requiring a 5-fold coincidence (two front paddles + CsI(Tl) crystal + two back  paddles).
The full DAQ system (crate + pc)  will be shielded in a van parked close to the well entrance. The power will be provided by a diesel power generator to minimize the requirements of long extension cords.

The  detector geometry as well as the realistic response of the CsI(Tl) crystal and plastic scintillators have been implemented in GEMC (see  Appendix B.2 of PR-16-001~\cite{bdx-proposal} for details about the detectors response  parametrisation). 
Figure~\ref{fig:det-gemc} shows the BDX-Hodo implementation in GEMC. 
To estimate rates, we assumed a detection threshold of 10 phe in scintillators and 100 phe in the crystal corresponding to 400 keV and 2 MeV of deposited energy respectively\footnote{MIPs release $\sim50$ phe ($\sim$2 MeV) and 1670 phe ($\sim$32 MeV)  respectively.}.
