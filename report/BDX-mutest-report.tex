We address the issues raised by JLAB-PAC44  regarding the experiment proposal  {\it PR-16-001 Dark matter search in a Beam-Dump eXperiment (BDX) at Jefferson Lab}~\cite{bdx-proposal}. Significant work has been completed in the area of simulation and preparation for a background measurement behind Hall A.
We have worked with the JLab Radiation Control group to develop the detailed geometry of the Hall A beam dump and incorporated it into
a FLUKA simulation of backgrounds. Detailed comparisons of GEANT4 and FLUKA have been made and show very good agreement for muon fluxes under
identical geometries, which are 
expected to be reliable in both simulations. We are now using FLUKA to simulate neutron backgrounds for the experiment using importance sampling to 
improve significance of small background signals at the sensitivity of the experiment. These simulations have also been used to estimate muon rates that can be
measured in test pipes located behind Hall A at beam level. Measuring the muon rates at this location will provide an absolute normalization of our Monte Carlo
simulations as well as confirm expected background rates for the present Hall A beam dump geometry. We provide a proposal and cost estimate for this measurement.

\section{Introduction}
In response to the issue raised by JLAB-PAC44  about the experiment proposal  {\it PR-16-001 Dark matter search in a Beam-Dump eXperiment (BDX) at Jefferson Lab}~\cite{bdx-proposal} we propose to measure  the muon flux and the prompt  background  produced by the interaction of the high intensity 11 GeV electron beam with the Hall-A beam-dump. The muon   flux will be sampled at different height (with-respect-to the beam axes), positions  and angles downstream of the beam-dump to map-out the radiation field in the location of the  future BDX hall.
In order to realistically assess the beam-on background experienced by the BDX detector, we will use a detector package (BDX-Hodo) containing a CsI(Tl) crystal from the  BDX electromagnetic calorimeter
surrounded by plastic scintillator paddles to trigger on horizontal muons and veto cosmic rays. The BDX-Hodo is specifically designed for this measurement and will use a  loose trigger to provide further information on 
beam-related  low energy background  (dominated by neutrons).
Although it will not be possible to directly compare results of this test with the experimental set-up proposed in PR-16-001, that will make use of a different and  optimized shielding, the measurement will be extremely useful to validate the Monte Carlo simulation tools (GEANT4 and FLUKA) used to design the new underground facility and optimize the BDX detector.

This report is organized as follow: 
results of the simulation of the radiation field produced by the interaction of the beam with the dump  are reported in Sec.~\ref{sec:sim}; the experimental set-up and the detector is described in Sec.\ref{sec:setup}; the expected results of the measurement are reported in Sec.~\ref{sec:results}. Details about cost estimate, work- and time-planes are reported in the Appendix.
