\subsection{The Hall-A high-power beam-dump}
The Hall A and C use identical high-power absorbing (up to 1 MW)  beam-dumps to stop the 11 GeV beam, remnant of beam/target interaction. The dump is 
composed of a set of about 80 aluminium disks, each
approximately 40 cm in diameter of increasing thickness (from 1 to 2 cm), for a total
length of approximately 200 cm, followed by a solid Al cylinder 50 cm in diameter
and approximately 100 cm long. The dump is cooled by circulating water. The full
drawing of the beam-dump is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:bd}. To increase the radiation shielding,
the thickness of the concrete tunnel surrounding the Al dump is about 4-5 m thick.

\subsection{The beam-dump model in FLUKA} 
The beam-dump geometry and  materials have  been implemented in FLUKA-2011.2c.5 by the Jefferson Lab Radiation Control Department. Details are reported in Ref.~\cite{jnote-bd}.  The input card used to run the program  includes all physics processes and a tuned set of weight biasing to speed up the running time while preserving the  results accuracy. 
The $\mu$, n, and $\gamma$ fluence (differential in angle and energy) per electrons-on-target (EOT) were  calculated  at  411.2 cm downstream of the beam window, through a circular area of 105 cm$^2$. Figure~\ref{fig:fluka-bd} shows the FLUKA graphic representation of the beam-dump and the location of the flux detector.
In our model we extended the original beam-dump description, by including  
 the proper geometry and material composition around and downstream of the beam-dump.
Figure~\ref{fig:fluka-bd-dwns}  shows the geometry of of the concrete bunker surrounding the beam-dump and  the downstream area filled by soil as implemented in our FLUKA model.



\subsection{The beam-dump model in GEANT4 (GEMC)}
The beam-dump, as well as the geometry and composition  of surrounding environment,
 has been implemented in GEANT4 using the GEMC tool~\cite{gemc}. This model is a refined version with respect to the one used  in PR-16-001~\cite{bdx-proposal} that better describes the beam-dump geometry, matching the level of details  implemented in the FLUKA model. For a better description of  muon transportation, the {\tt G4GammaConversionToMuons} has been added to the standard physics list used in simulations of  PR-16-001({\tt FTFP\_BERT\_HP + STD + HP}).
Particles fluence has been sampled  by mean of a flux detector  positioned in the same location as in the FLUKA model.
Figure~\ref{fig:gemc-bd-dwns} shows the beam-dump and vicinity implemented in GEMC.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Muons from beam-dump interaction}
A comparison of muon fluence downstream of the beam-dump (see above for details about the location)
obtained by FLUKA and GEMC are reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:mu-flu-bd}. Considering that low energy muons are absorbed by the bunker-head shielding, to keep the GEMC running time reasonable, only particles with energy greater than 100 MeV ({\tt ENERGY\_CUT=100*MeV}) have been tracked and sampled. A total of 4$\times10^9$ ($9\times 10^6$) EOT have been simulated with GEMC (FLUKA). The comparison of the two simulations shows a perfect agreement in the full energy range where data were generated.
In spite of a factor of $\times$100  less statistics, FLUKA shows, as expected, smaller error bars. This reflects the optimised weight biasing used by the simulation to generate high statistics for the low probability processes keeping the total number of events limited.
To penetrate  the concrete shielding and the soil, a minimum energy of  E$_\mu>4$ GeV is required. With this energy cut,   the integrated number of muon per EOT results in $4.8\pm 0.1 \times 10^{-7}$ ($5.5\pm 0.2 \times 10^{-7}$) for GEMC and FLUKA respectively.
Figure~\ref{fig:mu-flu-bd-2d} shows the correlation between the muon energy and the azimuthal angle (with-respect-to the beam axes): the regions  populated in both simulations show a similar shape.

\subsection{Sampling  and particle transport}\label{sec:sampling}
The good agreement between two independent simulation tools (FLUKA and GEMC)  gives us confidence about reliability of the obtained results. Both methods have pros and cons. FLUKA shows a superior speed in running but a complicated implementation of  variables of interest  (e.g. the final output is given via {\it scores} such as fluence or distribution in specific locations  need to be pre-defined). GEMC (GEANT4) tracks particles in all volumes providing a straightforward  output (particle four-momenta) in the desired flux detector but requires unrealistic running times to collect a reasonable statistics (in particular when an em shower is involved). In the following we describe how we overtook these difficulties.

\subsubsection{Muons - GEMC}\label{sec:gmc-mu}
We used GEMC to simulate muons. To make the  process more efficient, we followed the   procedure described below: 
\begin{itemize}
\item  we used a low statistic sample of EOT to simulate the interaction of the 11 GeV electrons with the beam-dump;
\item  we sampled the muon flux distribution in momentum, azimuthal angle and transverse position  on a flux detector located downstream of the beam-dump;
\item we used  distributions obtained  in the  previous step as input of a custom event-generator to produce a high statistic muon sample;
\item we used GEMC to transport muons  downstream of the beam-dump all the way down to the desired location(s) of  BDX-Hodo (see Section\,\ref{sec:BDX-hodo} for details);
\item  we implemented  the  BDX-Hodo response in GEMC to realistically describe the muon detection.
\end{itemize}
The area where  muons are sampled from the primary beam/dump interaction and used  as source in the custom-made event generator is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:mu-gen}.

\includegraphics[width=12cm]{figs/mu-gen.pdf}   
\caption{The  $\mu$ sampling/generation area is the surface enclosed by  the magenta circle.}
\label{fig:mu-gen}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:mu-sampling} shows the muon distributions (energy vs azimuthal angle and radial distance from the beam line) downstream of the beam-dump, as obtained by the full GEMC simulation of  11 GeV electrons hitting the beam-dump.
The left panel of Fig.~\ref{fig:mu-sampling-extract} shows the  distributions obtained by running the full simulation with GEMC compared to  the custom event generator results. 
As a check, the right panel of the same figure  shows the  comparison in the location of interest ($\sim 20$ m downstream of the beam-dump).
The difference in the error bar size indicates the improvement obtained by adopting this procedure.

\label{fig:bg-csi}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Background - FLUKA} 
We used FLUKA to estimate the background expected in the BDX-Hodo detector.
We simulated an 11 GeV electron-beam interacting with the beam-dump, propagate all particles to the location of interest obtaining the fluence on the CsI(Tl) surface.
Figure ~\ref{fig:bg-csi} shows the resulting fluence per EOT as a function of energy  for all particles (black) and muons only (red).
As expected,  muons are the only high energetic  particles reaching  the crystal while other species (neutrons mainly) account for the low energy of the spectrum. More details are reported in Sec.~\ref{sec:results}.

\label{fig:n-comp}
\end{figure}

It's interesting to note that the spectrum of  high energy neutrons , T$_n>$ 100 MeV,  (sampled downstream of the dump)  obtained by GEMC is in good agreement with FLUKA (see Fig.~\ref{fig:n-comp}). The agreement indicates  that, in this energy range, both simulation tools are reliable. 

Another interesting aspect of the neutron spectrum is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:n-lowE}. The energy spectrum (sampled downstream of the dump) obtained by FLUKA by RadCon (Ref.~\cite{jnote-bd}) is compared to the same plot obtained by our FLUKA simulations. The two models differ in the implementation of the  beam-dump vault: a detailed description of the material surrounding the dump,  that includes air and concrete,  versus a simplified geometry/material description.   The effect is clearly visible in the low energy part of the spectrum (while the high energy part is almost identical) proving that a detailed description of the dump enclosure is necessary to correctly describe the low energy backgrounds.
